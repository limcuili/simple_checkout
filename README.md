This is Week 2 of Makers.

# simple_checkout

I have noticed over the last two weeks that I'm not consistently committing my changes and pushing them to github as appropriate. I also sometimes have trouble writing the spec file before the code.  
This is a simple exerice to practice the TDD process and to encourage the habit of committing my project changes.

## Project Instructions
Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items. Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

The requirements for the system are as follows:

As a shopper
So I know how much an item costs
I would like to be able to see its price

As a shopper
So that I can buy an item
I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout

As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items

As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)
